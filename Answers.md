What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
- If i had  more time, I would definitely consider adding a detailed document explaining the code methods.
- If I had more time i would have added more unit test to the application.
- I would also go further to adding integration test to the backend service and also simulate an end-to-end test between the frontend and the backend service.
- Due to the restrictions of the free tier third party API in use, the crypto quotes received is in the base rate in Euro.
- I would also have optimize the application for scalability to handle large data and improve the caching system.
- Additionally, I could improve the user interface by making it more intuitive, visually appealing and responsive.
- I would have implement a robust error logging system to track and address any issues that may arise during the application operation

##
How long did you spend on the coding assignment
-  I spent about 2 hours working on this problem and another hour or so researching how to approach it daily within the 7days deadline.

##
What do you think about this assessment?
- I think the technical assessment demonstrates a solid foundation, and with some refinements, it has the potential to deliver a robust and user friendly solutions.
